<p>Detection results and winners' methods were presented at the ICCV 2015 <a href="http://image-net.org/challenges/ilsvrc+mscoco2015" target="_blank">ImageNet and COCO Visual Recognition Challenges Joint Workshop</a> (slides and recording of all talks are now available). Challenge winners along with up-to-date results are available to view on the <a href="#detection-leaderboard">leaderboard</a>. The evaluation server remains open for upload of new results.</p>

<h1>1. Overview</h1>
<p>We are pleased to announce the COCO Object Detection Task. This task is designed to push the state of the art in object detection forward. Teams are encouraged to compete in either (or both) of two object detection tasks: using bounding box output or object segmentation output.</p>
<p>This detection challenge is part of the <a href="http://image-net.org/challenges/ilsvrc+mscoco2015" target="_blank">ImageNet and COCO Visual Recognition Challenges</a> joint workshop at ICCV 2015. For further details about the joint workshop please visit the workshop page.</p>
<p>The COCO train, validation, and test sets, containing more than 200,000 images and 80 object categories, are available on the <a href="#download">download</a> page. All object instance are annotated with a detailed segmentation mask. Annotations on the training and validation sets (with over 500,000 object instances segmented) are publicly available.</p>
