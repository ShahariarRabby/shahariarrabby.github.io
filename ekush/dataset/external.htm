    Full Ekush Dataset</a></h1>
<p>
    The extracted image is saved as the JPEG format and each image has a unique ID or name that represent writer gender,
    hometown, age, education level, and serial number. In order to store the writer information which helps to identify
    that person using an ID. So that this dataset not only uses for handwritten recognition but also help to predict a
    person gender, age and his or her location as well as it can help investigators focusing more on a certain category
    of suspects and forensic purposes. This id or name fixed according to the following criteria, Its first one digit
    indicates writer gender. If it is 0 which means the writer was male and1 means writers were female. After that have

<p>MatriVasha the largest dataset of handwritten Bangla compound characters for research
    on handwritten Bangla compound character recognition. The
    proposed dataset contains 120 different types of compound characters that consist of 306,464‬
    images written where 152,950 male and 153,514 female handwritten Bangla compound characters. This
    dataset can be used for other issues such as gender, age, district base handwriting research
    because the sample was collected that included district authenticity, age group, and an
