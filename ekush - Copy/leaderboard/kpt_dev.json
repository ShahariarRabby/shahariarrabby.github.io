This paper proposes a new CNN architecture which combines the key-points estimators and an object detector. This network can detect poses of all people and the around objects in the image in parallel. In general, to address the multi-person pose estimation, the network generates human key-point heatmaps and bounding boxes simultaneously. Then, for each person-bounding-box, it crops image and the heatmaps based on the coordinate. These cropped images are passed through another single-person pose estimator to generate the pose of person inside the bounding box. The proposed network is just trained on the COCO train dataset with augmentation.  The proposed network is implemented based on mxnet, run on a desktop with GTX 1080Ti devices. It takes 0.244 seconds for generating heatmaps and bounding boxes, and 0.1 seconds for estimating pose of single person.","url":"","results":"{\"AP_50\": \"0.765\", \"AP\": \"0.522\", \"AP_medium\": \"0.542\", \"AR\": \"0.589\", \"AR_50\": \"0.804\", \"AP_large\": \"0.575\", \"AR_large\": \"0.635\", \"AR_75\": \"0.634\", \"AR_medium\": \"0.556\", \"AP_75\": \"0.571\"}","leaderboard_name":"kpt-challenge2018","team":{"name":"UOU_ISLab","members":"Van-Thanh Hoang, Intelligent System Lab., School of Electrical Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, Korea, Kang-Hyun Jo, Intelligent System Lab., School of Electrical Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, Korea"},"date":"2018-09-09","publication":""}
