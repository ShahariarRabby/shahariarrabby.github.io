<p class="fontBig">The <a href="https://places-coco2017.github.io/#winners">Challenge Winners</a> have now been announced! Up-to-date results are on the <a href="#keypoints-leaderboard">keypoints leaderboard</a>. Note that the evaluation server on test-dev remains open for uploading of new results.</p>

<h1>1. Overview</h1>
<p>The COCO Keypoint Detection Task requires localization of person keypoints in challenging, uncontrolled conditions. The keypoint task involves simultaneously detecting people <i>and</i> localizing their keypoints (person locations are <i>not</i> given at test time). For full details of this task please see the <a href="#keypoints-eval">keypoint evaluation</a> page.</p>
<p>This task is part of the <a href="https://places-coco2017.github.io/">Joint COCO and Places Recognition Challenge Workshop</a> at ICCV 2017. For further details about the joint workshop please visit the workshop page. Please also see the related COCO <a href="#detection-2017">detection</a> and <a href="#stuff-2017">stuff</a> tasks.</p>
<p>The COCO train, validation, and test sets, containing more than 200,000 images and 250,000 person instances labeled with keypoints (the majority of people in COCO at medium and large scales) are available for <a href="#download">download</a>. Annotations on train and val (with over 150,000 people and 1.7 million labeled keypoints) are publicly available.</p>
<p>This is the second iteration of keypoint task and it exactly follows the <a href="#keypoints-2016">COCO 2016 Keypoint Detection Task</a>. In particular, the same overall data and metrics are being used for this year's task. The mains differences are that now <b>(1) the test set only contains two splits: test-dev and test-challenge,</b> and <b>(2) the train/val sets are arranged differently</b>. Please see the <a href="#download">download</a> and <a href="#guidelines">guidelines</a> pages for details about the setup for the 2017 data and test splits.</p>
